# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration
A model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City using Python.
Since KNN model doesn't work well with a large dataset, I've trim the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
According to the data description we should find the following columns:
id - a unique identifier for each trip
vendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record
pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged
dropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged
passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)
pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged
pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged
dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged
dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged
store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server (Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip)
trip_duration - (target) duration of the trip in seconds
Here, we have 2 variables dropoff_datetime and store_and_fwd_flag which are not available before the trip starts and hence will not be used as features to the model.
Missing Values: Knowing about missing values is important because they indicate how much we donâ€™t know about our data. Making inferences based on just a few cases is often unwise. In addition, many modelling procedures break down when missing values are involved and the corresponding rows will either have to be removed completely or the values need to be estimated somehow.
